=head1 NAME

Data::FormValidator::Constraints - Basic sets of constraints on input profile.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Data::FormValidator::Constraints qw(:all);

In an Data::FormValidator profile:

    constraint_methods => {
	    email	=> email(),
	    fax		=> american_phone(),
	    phone	=> american_phone(),
	    state	=> state(),
	},


=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the builtin constraints that can be specified by name in the input
profiles. 

Be sure to check out the SEE ALSO section for even more pre-packaged
constraints you can use.

=cut

sub AUTOLOAD {
    my $name = $AUTOLOAD;

	no strict qw/refs/;

	$name =~ m/^(.*::)(valid_|RE_)(.*)/;

	my ($pkg,$prefix,$sub) = ($1,$2,$3);

	#warn "hello!  my ($pkg,$prefix,$sub) = ($1,$2,$3);";

    # Since all the valid_* routines are essentially identical we're
    # going to generate them dynamically from match_ routines with the same names.
	if ((defined $prefix) and ($prefix eq 'valid_')) {
		return defined &{$pkg.'match_' . $sub}(@_);
    }
}

=item email

Checks if the email LOOKS LIKE an email address. This should be sufficient
99% of the time. 

Look elsewhere if you want something super fancy that matches every possible variation
that is valid in the RFC, or runs out and checks some MX records.

=item zip

This input validator checks if the input is a valid american zipcode :
5 digits followed by an optional mailbox number.

=cut

sub match_zip {

=item phone

This one checks if the input looks like a phone number, (if it
contains at least 6 digits.)

=cut

=item american_phone

This constraints checks if the number is a possible North American style
of phone number : (XXX) XXX-XXXX. It has to contains 7 or more digits.

=cut

sub match_american_phone {
    my $val = shift;

    if ($val =~ /^((?:\D*\d\D*){7,})$/) {

}


=pod

=item cc_number

This constraint references the value of a credit card type field.

 constraint_methods => {
    cc_no      => cc_number({fields => ['cc_type']}),
  }


The number is checked only for plausibility, it checks if the number could
be valid for a type of card by checking the checksum and looking at the number
of digits and the number of digits of the number.

This functions is only good at catching typos. IT DOESN'T
CHECK IF THERE IS AN ACCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMBER.

=head1 REGEXP::COMMON SUPPORT

Data::FormValidator also includes built-in support for using any of regular expressions
in L<Regexp::Common> as named constraints. Simply use the name of regular expression you want.
This works whether you want to untaint the data or not. For example:

 use Data::FormValidator::Constraints qw(:regexp_common);

 constraint_methods => {
	my_ip_address => FV_net_IPv4(),

	# An example with parameters
	other_ip      => FV_net_IPv4(-sep=>' '),
 }

Notice that the routines are named with the prefix "FV_" instead of "RE_" now. 
This is simply a visual cue that these are slightly modified versions. We've made
a wrapper for each Regexp::Common routine so that it can be used as a named constraint 
like this. 

Be sure to check out the L<Regexp::Common> syntax for how its syntax works. It
will make more sense to add future regular expressions to Regexp::Common rather
than to Data::FormValidator.

=head1 PROCEDURAL INTERFACE

You may also call these functions directly through the procedural
interface by either importing them directly or importing the whole
I<:validators> group. This is useful if you want to use the built-in validators
out of the usual profile specification interface. 


For example, if you want to access the I<email> validator
directly, you could either do:

    use Data::FormValidator::Constraints (qw/valid_email/);
    or
    use Data::FormValidator::Constraints (:validators);

    if (valid_email($email)) {
      # do something with the email address
    }

Notice that when you call validators directly, you'll need to prefix the
validator name with "valid_" 

Each validator also has a version that returns the untainted value if
the validation succeeded. You may call these functions directly
through the procedural interface by either importing them directly or
importing the I<:matchers> group. For example if you want to untaint a
value with the I<email> validator directly you may:

    if ($email = match_email($email)) {
        system("echo $email");
    }
    else {
        die "Unable to validate email";
    }

Notice that when you call validators directly and want them to return an
untainted value, you'll need to prefix the validator name with "match_"

=head1 WRITING YOUR OWN CONSTRAINT ROUTINES

=head2 New School Constraints Overview

This is the current recommended way to write constraints. See also L<Old School
Constraints>.

The most flexible way to create constraints to use closures-- a normal seeming
outer subroutine which returins a customized DFV method subroutine as a result.
It's easy to do. These "constraint methods" can be named whatever you like, and
imported normally into the name space where the profile is located. 

Let's look at an example. 

  # Near your profile	
  # Of course, you don't have to export/import if your constraints are in the same
  # package as the profile.  
  use My::Constraints qw(coolness);

  # In your profile
  constraint_methods => {
    email 			 => email(),
	prospective_date => coolness(
		min => 40,
		max => 60,
		{fields => [qw/personality smarts good_looks/]}
	),
  }

Let's look at how this complex C<coolness> constraint method works. The 
interface asks for users to define minimum and maximum coolness values, as
well as declaring three data field names that we should peek into to look 
their values. 

Here's what the code might look like:

  sub coolness {
 	my ($min_cool,$max_cool, $attrs) = @_; 
	my ($personality,$smarts,$looks) = @{ $attrs->{fields} } if $attrs->{fields};
	return sub {
		my $dfv = shift;

		# Name it to refer to in the 'msgs' system.
		$dfv->name_this('coolness');

		my $val = $dfv->get_current_constraint_value();

		# get other data to refer to
	    my $data = $dfv->get_input_data;

	    my $has_all_three = ($data->{personality} && $data->{smarts} && $data->{looks});
		return ( ($val >= $min_cool) && ($val <= $max_cool) && $has_all_three );
	}
  }


Here is documentation on how old school constraints are created. These are
supported, but the the new school style documented above is recommended. 

See also the C<validator_packages> option in the input profile, for loading 
sets of old school constraints from other packages. 

Old school constraint routines are named two ways. Some are named with the
prefix C<match_> while others start with C<valid_>. The difference is that the
C<match_> routines are built to untaint the data and return a safe version of
it if it validates, while C<valid_> routines simply return a true value if the
validation succeeds and false otherwise.

It is preferable to write C<match_> routines that untaint data for the extra
security benefits. Plus, Data::FormValidator will AUTOLOAD a C<valid_> version
if anyone tries to use it, so you only need to write one routine to cover both
cases. 

Usually constraint routines only need one input, the value being specified.
However, sometimes more than one value is needed. 

B<Example>:

		image_field  => {  
			constraint_method  => 'max_image_dimensions',
			params => [\100,\200],
		},

Using that syntax, the first parameter that will be passed to the routine is
the Data::FormValidator object. The remaining parameters will come from the
C<params> array. Strings will be replaced by the values of fields with the same names,
and references will be passed directly.

In addition to C<constraint_method>, there is also an even older technique using
the name C<constraint> instead. Routines that are designed to work with
C<constraint> I<don't> have access to Data::FormValidator object, which
means users need to pass in the name of the field being validated. Besides
adding unnecessary syntax to the user interface, it won't work in conjunction
with C<constraint_regexp_map>.

=head2 Methods available for use inside of constraints

A few useful methods to use on the Data::FormValidator::Results object are
available to you to use inside of your routine.

=over 4

=item get_input_data()

Returns the raw input data. This may be a CGI object if that's what 
was used in the constraint routine. 

B<Examples:>

 # Raw and uncensored
 my $data = $self->get_input_data;

 # tamed to be a hashref, if it wasn't already
 my $data = $self->get_input_data( as_hashref => 1 );

=item get_current_constraint_field

Returns the name of the current field being tested in the constraint.

B<Example>:

 my $field = $self->get_current_constraint_field;

This reduces the number of parameters that need to be passed into the routine
and allows multi-valued constraints to be used with C<constraint_regexp_map>.

For complete examples of multi-valued constraints, see L<Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Upload>

=item get_current_constraint_value

Returns the name of the current value being tested in the constraint.

B<Example>:

 my $value = $self->get_current_constraint_value;

This reduces the number of parameters that need to be passed into the routine
and allows multi-valued constraints to be used with C<constraint_regexp_map>.

=item get_current_constraint_name

Returns the name of the current constraint being applied

B<Example>:

 my $value = $self->get_current_constraint_name;

This is useful for building a constraint on the fly based on it's name.
It's used internally as part of the interface to the L<Regexp::Commmon>
regular expressions.

=item name_this
=item set_current_constraint_name

Sets the name of the current constraint being applied.

B<Example>:

 sub my_constraint {
	my @outer_params = @_;
	return sub {
		my $dfv = shift;
		$dfv->set_current_constraint_name('my_constraint');
		my @params = @outer_params;
		# do something constraining here...
	}
 }

By returning a closure which uses this method,  you can build an advanced named
constraint in your profile, before you actually have access to the DFV object
that will be used later. See Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Upload for an
example.

C<name_this> is a provided as a shorter synonym.

The C<meta()> method may also be useful to communicate meta data that
may have been found. See L<Data::FormValidator::Results> for documentation
of that method.

=head1  BACKWARDS COMPATIBLITY

Prior to Data::FormValidator 4.00, contraints were specified a bit differently.
This older style is still supported. 

It was not necessary to explicitly load some constraints into your name space,
and the names were given as strings, like this:

    constraints  => {
	    email	      => 'email',
	    fax		      => 'american_phone',
	    phone	      => 'american_phone',
	    state	      => 'state',
		my_ip_address => 'RE_net_IPv4',
		other_ip => {
			constraint => 'RE_net_IPv4',
			params => [ \'-sep'=> \' ' ],
		},
		my_cc_no      => {
			constraint => 'cc_number',
			params => [qw/cc_no cc_type/],
		}
	},

  A newer DateTime constraint module. May save you a step of tranforming the date into
  a more useful format after it's validated.
