3.01 Thu May 15 2003
	This release fixes addresses a couple of issues related to the new support
	for error message handling through msgs() and "qr" support. If you aren't
	using these features, there's no need to upgrade. 

	- New Feature: Updated msgs() documentation and removed the requirement
	that 'msgs' be defined in profile for default formatting to be used with
	msgs() method call.

	- Bug Fix: Using named constraints wtih the new "qr" support now works.

3.00 Sun May 11 2003
	- New Feature: added debug option
	- Make default msgs in "new" constructor work as it was supposed it 2.11_04
	- Bug Fix: missing_optional_valid now works better when the input data comes
		from a CGI.pm or Apache::Request object (David Ranney)
	- Upload.pm syntax updated to no longer require Perl 5.6+ syntax
	- New Feature: Upload.pm now first tries to use File::MMagic and MIME::Type 
      to more intelligently determine the file type and an appropriate extension.

2.11_04
	- Major documentation overhaul. It should now be easier to browse and grok.

	- New Feature: defaults can be passed to new() that will be used for all
	  forms made from that object.

	- New Feature: Added support for quoting regular expressions using "qr" 
	  instead of defining them as strings. This is now the preferred method.
	  Defining regular expressions as strings is deprecated but supported.

	- New Feature: Friendly die statements when you have typos in filter 
		and constraint names. (Instead of mysterious suicide). 

	- Fixed syntax error in Upload.pm documentation
	- Bug Fix: error checking in valid_file_format in Upload.pm
	- Bug Fix: fixed bug related to returning constraint names introduced
		in 2.11_03.

2.11_03
	- The code has now been reorganized, following the module of HTML::FormValidator.
	  Filters, Constraints, and Results are now all handled in their own modules. 

	- The "msgs" error functional has now been re-designed, and is not
	  backwards compatible. Feedback on this experimental addition is encouraged.

	- New Feature: Added ConstraintsFactory.pm module to distribution

2.11_02
	- New Feature: Support for Apache::Request objects
	- New Feature: Now when constraint_regexp_map is used
		and one or more constraints is already defined, the new
		matching constraint is added to the list of constraints 
		applied, rather than superceding the old one. 

2.11_01 (A BETA release)

	- New Feature: Added Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Upload
		to the distribution.

	- New Feature: Added Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Dates
		to the distribution.

	- The functionality of returning errors with the experimental 
	  msgs feature has changed a bit. Now if you define multiple constraints,
	  the messages will always be returned as an array reference, instead of
	  when only there was more than one message. This should improve
	  integration with HTML::Template.

	- New Feature: When using multiple constraints defined as hash references,
	  the "name" attribute will default to name of the constraint, if it is
	  being called by name. 

	- added documentation for writing your own validation routines.
	- New Feature: Added 'valid' accessor/mutator method to manage
	  and manipulate the result set. This can be useful to modify 
	  the result set from within a constraint.

	- New Feature: Added "constraint_method" as an alternative
		to "constraint" in the hash-based constraint definition. 
		Related to this, there are new accessor methods for use
		inside of custom constraints:
			get_input_data();
			get_current_constraint_field();
			get_current_constraint_value();

		This whole arrangement brings support for multi-valued constraints with
		constraint_regexp_map

	- various documentation clean ups

2.10 Sun Apr 20 2003
	- New Feature: (EXPERIMENTAL) Added support for returning error messages
	  for missing and invalid fields (Juan Jose Natera Abreu).
	  This piece of functionality is marked as experimental because
	  the interface may change in the near future, and it has not been
	  tested as well as rest of the module. Search in the documentation for
	  "msgs" for the details.

	- New Feature: added support for building with Module::Build. For more
	  information on Module::Build, read this:
	  http://magnonel.guild.net/~schwern/talks/MakeMaker_Is_DOOMED/slides/

	- New Feature: included SIGNATURE file in distribution for verification
	  with Module::Signature

2.04 Fri Apr 11 2003
	- Bug Fix: multiple parameters passed to a constraint
	were not being handled appropriately in some cases. (Markus)
	- Bug Fix: Calling "validate" as a class method in combination
	with using "validator_packages no longer causes a problem.

2.03 Thu Apr 10 2003
     - Bug Fix: use of "delete" syntax with multiple values updated
	 	to be backwards compatible with Perl 5.005 (Jonathan Buhacoff) 

2.02 Wed Apr 09 2003
	- Bug Fix: fixed bug with required_regexp and optional_regexp triggered  
	if there is no required_regexp or optional_regexp in the profile *and*
	something exists in $@ (Dom)

2.01 Wed Apr 02 2003
	- Bug Fix: Fix bug introduced in 1.93 which didn't handle
		input values appropriately that were references to other things
		besides arrays. (Boris Zentner)

2.00 Sat Mar 22 2003
	- Bug Fix: Fixed bug where all code references were treated as if the were
	  using the 'multiple constraints' feature.  This bug was likely introduced
	  in 1.93 (Chris Spiegel)
	- Bug Fix: Fixed bug which caused a failllure when using some sides of
	  subroutine constraints within the "multiple constraints" syntax. 
	  (Chris Spiegal}

1.93 Sun Mar 09 2003
	- New Feature: Keys with multiple values are now supported
	- New Feature: A CGI.pm object can now be used to provide the input data

	  (Tony Stubblebine)
	- Bug Fix: better support for using valid_* packages imported from other
	  packages. (Alexander Solovey)
	- added link to demo site in documentation
	- fixed typo in documentation example (Kato Atsushi)
	- added link to Japanese translatation of the documents (Kato Atsushi)

	- Added "missing_optional_valid" flag to profiles to allow missing
	  optional fields to be considered valid

1.7   Sat Nov 03 2001
    - Fixed broken constraint_regexp_map implementation. If you
	  followed the example syntax in the documentation your regular
	  expression could have failed to match when it should have
